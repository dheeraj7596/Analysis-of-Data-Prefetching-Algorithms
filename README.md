# Analysis-of-Data-Prefetching-Algorithms

Apart from analysing the algorithms using the source files from the contest, we have implemented the Adaptive multi-stream prefetching algorithm (amp.c) which can be run on the DPC2 framework.

To run this, please download the DPC2 simulator from http://comparch-conf.gatech.edu/dpc2/. Copy this file in dpc2sim/example_prefetchers and then follow the instructions inside the README in the dpc2sim folder.

Results of the benchmarks have been included in the report.
